## Data Requirements

The website expects a file named `df.rds` in the `myapp/` directory containing the survey data with the following key columns:

- `consent`: Survey consent status
- `completed_time`, `started_time`: Timestamp data
- `site`, `woreda`, `username`: Geographic and enumerator information
- `duration_minutes`: Survey duration
- `hh_size`, `education_level`, `age`, `sex`: Demographic data
- `ps_num_planted_*`, `num_surv_*`: Tree planting and survival data

## Advantages over Shiny App

1. **Better Performance**: Static generation with interactive JavaScript
2. **No Server Required**: Can be hosted on any static hosting service
3. **Better SEO**: Search engine friendly
4. **Offline Capability**: Works without internet connection once loaded
5. **Version Control Friendly**: All code is in text files
6. **Easy Deployment**: Simple file upload to hosting service
7. **Better Caching**: Faster load times for repeat visitors
