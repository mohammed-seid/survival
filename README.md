## Data Source

### CommCare Integration
The website fetches data directly from CommCare using the API with the following configuration:

- **Username**: mohammed.seidhussen@oneacrefund.org
- **Project Space**: oaf-ethiopia  
- **Form ID**: e24ab639e5b7d1b609cf2894f7057b75

### Data Processing
- Automatic data fetching with progress tracking
- Real-time data processing and cleaning
- Privacy protection (sensitive fields automatically excluded)
- Data validation and type conversion

### Expected Data Structure
The data should contain the following key columns:
- `consent`: Survey consent status
- `completed_time`, `started_time`: Timestamp data
- `site`, `woreda`, `username`: Geographic and enumerator information
- `duration_minutes`: Survey duration
- `hh_size`, `education_level`, `age`, `sex`: Demographic data
- `ps_num_planted_*`, `num_surv_*`: Tree planting and survival data

**Note**: Sensitive fields (`farmer_name`, `name`, `phone_no`, `tno`) are automatically excluded for privacy.
